                            <p> A simple game about escaping floods in various buildings, getting to the escape point before the rooms fills with water, killing you. In order to get to the end of the room, however, you would need to press different buttons to open up pathways that would lead to the end, which could take extra time to get to, leading to more precision in getting to the end. </p>

                            <p> Flood Escape: Classics somewhat simple yet effective gameplay loop struck gold when it came out, getting thousands of players every day. It remained like that for quite a while, since it was easy to get hooked into its gameplay, especially when there were more difficulties to master than just one. </p>

                            <p> Flood Escape: Classic's decrease in popularity is pretty much given to one factor: the development and release of Flood Escape 2. Due to working on their second game, Crazyblox had almost abandoned the first game, leaving its player count to dwindle, leaving it at almost 100 active players at most to this day. </p>
