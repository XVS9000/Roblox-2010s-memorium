                            <h3>Description:</h3>
                            <p> The name is as appropriate as it looks. In this game, you try not to get crushed by a speeding wall, through small holes in the walls on the side of the stage to hide from it, only moving when the speeding wall isn’t. It was this simple gameplay that caught the attention of many in the past, but has died out in recent years due to a lack of updates and add-ons to the gameplay. </p>
