                            <h3>In its Prime:</h3>
                            <p> Previously mentioned, Welcome to the Town of Robloxia became known as one of the most popular and well-established games on the platform, amassing thousands of players and a grand total of thirty-six million visits before the developer ultimately got banned due to involvement in an april fools incident on the platform. </p>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Where it is now:</h3>
                            <p> After the termination of 1dev2's account, the game became uncopylocked, which allowed other users to essentially use the game for their own games. Welcome to the Town of Robloxia's downfall is almost entirely given to the fact that 1dev2's account got terminated, not allowing for any further updates on the game, leaving it to fall behind as roblox as a platform evolved. At this point in time, this game only has 3 active users. </p>
