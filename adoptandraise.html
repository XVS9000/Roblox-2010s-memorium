                            <h3>Description:</h3>
                            <p> A very simple roleplaying game where you do as the title suggests, adopt and raise a cute kid. You and other players could roam and do various tasks around the map, but wouldn’t really progress anything as it would all be to act as a family. An odd game, but one people found interesting nonetheless. </p>

                            <h3>In its Prime:</h3>
                            <p> The game primarily gained popularity in 2017-2018 due to youtubers like Flamingo making videos on it. The game quickly stopped being a roleplaying game and turned into a battleground, doing various acts to mess everyone up and ruin everything around you. It turned an odd game into a rather fun one, one that gained thousands of players. </p>

                            <h3>Where it is now:</h3>
                            <p> After the fire resides, Adopt and Raise a Cute Kid ended up getting removed from the platform due to scummy tactics the owner utilized in the game to make money. After various events took place, ownership was given to someone else, and the game underwent various redesigns that a lot of people just didn’t like. All of these events caused the game to lose its players, where it now can’t hold any more than 100 active players at one time. </p>
