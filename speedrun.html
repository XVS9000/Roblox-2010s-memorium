                            <h3>Description:</h3>
                            <p> A high speed platformer that made sure you had the skill to make it to the end. It differed from the rest of its time in a sense that it used speed as a mechanic to make the levels more difficult, despite it making it more fun. Tighter jumps became difficult at high speeds, and tighter jumps were definitely made more prevalent as it progressed. </p>

                            <h3>In its Prime:</h3>
                            <p> At its best, Speed Run 4 was a game adored by many for its simplistic yet adrenaline-inducing gameplay that was easy to pick up but hard to master. Over time, the developers of the game decided to change how the core game mechanics worked, or what they even were, losing out on its tens of thousands of active players it used to have. </p>

                        <div>
                            <h3>Where it is now:</h3>
                            <p> At its current state, Speed Run 4 is not the game it certainly used to be. As Roblox has evolved, a lot of the games on the platform have leaned towards making as much money as possible rather than making games you can have fun on. Despite Speed Run 4 still having around one to two thousand players at a time, the death of this game resides in it transitioning into a game centered around money rather than fun. </p>
