                            <h3>Description:</h3>
                            <p> Despite the name, you ride on an elevator that takes you to various floors that most would describe as irregular. Each floor has something unique, from a chicken eating contest to floating waffles in a void, this game has a lot of unique floors to randomly stumble upon. </p>

                            <h3>In its Prime:</h3>
                            <p> In its prime, Normal Elevator was a blast to get through. With each floor feeling new and fitting into its time period, it garnered a massive amount of players at most times, typically having thousands of concurrent players. Various Youtubers even caught wind of it, with DanTDM, EthanGamer, and DennisDaily being some of the more popular cameos. </p>

                            <h3>Where it is now:</h3>
                            <p> Normal Elevator has lost a significant amount of its usual playerbase, only amassing roughly 50-300 players a day. In comparison to its highest amount in its prime, it’s not nearly as popular as it once was. </p>
